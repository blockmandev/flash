**Flash is a next generation Tensor Library and Deep Learning Framework that doesn't compromise on
<br /> flexibility, efficiency and portability.**

<br/>
</div>

<div align="left">

Flash is both a tensor library and a deep learning framework optimized for numerical computing, model
inference and model training. Flash leverages Rust to perform optimizations normally only available
in static-graph frameworks, offering optimal speed without impacting flexibility.

## Backend


Flash strives to be as fast as possible on as many hardwares as possible, with robust
implementations. We believe this flexibility is crucial for modern needs where you may train your
models in the cloud, then deploy on customer hardwares, which vary from user to user.

| no-std | -            | ☑️      | -        |

<br />

Compared to other frameworks, Flash has a very different approach to supporting many backends. By
design, most code is generic over the Backend trait, which allows us to build Flash with swappable
backends. This makes composing backend possible, augmenting them with additional functionalities
such as autodifferentiation and automatic kernel fusion.

<details>
<summary>
Autodiff: Backend decorator that brings backpropagation to any backend 🔄
</summary>
<br />

Contrary to the aforementioned backends, Autodiff is actually a backend _decorator_. This means that
it cannot exist by itself; it must encapsulate another backend.

The simple act of wrapping a base backend with Autodiff transparently equips it with
autodifferentiation support, making it possible to call backward on your model.

```rust
use Flash::backend::{Autodiff, Wgpu};
use Flash::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff<Wgpu>;

    let device = Default::default();

    let x: Tensor<Backend, 2> = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default, &device);
    let y: Tensor<Backend, 2> = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default, &device).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&grads).unwrap();
    println!("{y_grad}");
}
```

Of note, it is impossible to make the mistake of calling backward on a model that runs on a backend
that does not support autodiff (for inference), as this method is only offered by an Autodiff
backend.

See the [Autodiff Backend README](./crates/Flash-autodiff/README.md) for more details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Fusion: Backend decorator that brings kernel fusion to all first-party backends
</summary>
<br />

This backend decorator enhances a backend with kernel fusion, provided that the inner backend
supports it. Note that you can compose this backend with other backend decorators such as Autodiff.
All first-party accelerated backends (like WGPU and CUDA) use Fusion by default (`Flash/fusion`
feature flag), so you typically don't need to apply it manually.

```rust
#[cfg(not(feature = "fusion"))]
pub type Cuda<F = f32, I = i32> = CubeBackend<CudaRuntime, F, I, u8>;

#[cfg(feature = "fusion")]
pub type Cuda<F = f32, I = i32> = Flash_fusion::Fusion<CubeBackend<CudaRuntime, F, I, u8>>;
```

Of note, we plan to implement automatic gradient checkpointing based on compute bound and memory
bound operations, which will work gracefully with the fusion backend to make your code run even
faster during training, see [this issue](https://github.com/blockcmandev/Flash/issues/936).

See the [Fusion Backend README](./crates/Flash-fusion/README.md) for more details.

<details>
<summary>
Router (Beta): Backend decorator that composes multiple backends into a single one
</summary>
<br />

That backend simplifies hardware operability, if for instance you want to execute some operations on
the CPU and other operations on the GPU.

```rust
use Flash::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};
use Flash::backend::{
    NdArray, Router, Wgpu, ndarray::NdArrayDevice, router::duo::MultiDevice, wgpu::WgpuDevice,
};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Router<(Wgpu, NdArray)>;

    let device_0 = MultiDevice::B1(WgpuDevice::DiscreteGpu(0));
    let device_1 = MultiDevice::B2(NdArrayDevice::Cpu);

    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::<Backend, 2>::random([3, 3], Flash::tensor::Distribution::Default, &device_0);
    let tensor_cpu =
        Tensor::<Backend, 2>::random([3, 3], Flash::tensor::Distribution::Default, &device_1);
}

```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Remote (Beta): Backend decorator for remote backend execution, useful for distributed computations
</summary>
<br />

That backend has two parts, one client and one server. The client sends tensor operations over the
network to a remote compute backend. You can use any first-party backend as server in a single line
of code:

```rust
fn main_server() {
    // Start a server on port 3000.
    Flash::server::start::<Flash::backend::Cuda>(Default::default(), 3000);
}

fn main_client() {
    // Create a client that communicate with the server on port 3000.
    use Flash::backend::{Autodiff, RemoteBackend};

    type Backend = Autodiff<RemoteDevice>;

    let device = RemoteDevice::new("ws://localhost:3000");
    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::<Backend, 2>::random([3, 3], Distribution::Default, &device);
}

```

## Training & Inference


The whole deep learning workflow is made easy with Flash, as you can monitor your training progress
with an ergonomic dashboard, and run inference everywhere from embedded devices to large GPU
clusters.

Flash was built from the ground up with training and inference in mind. It's also worth noting how
Flash, in comparison to frameworks like PyTorch, simplifies the transition from training to
deployment, eliminating the need for code changes.

As you can see in the previous video (click on the picture!), a new terminal UI dashboard based on
the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate allows users to follow their training
with ease without having to connect to any external application.

You can visualize your training and validation metrics updating in real-time and analyze the
lifelong progression or recent history of any registered metrics using only the arrow keys. Break
from the training loop without crashing, allowing potential checkpoints to be fully written or
important pieces of code to complete without interruption 🛡

Let's start with a code snippet that shows how intuitive the framework is to use! In the following,
we declare a neural network module with some parameters along with its forward pass.

```rust
use Flash::nn;
use Flash::module::Module;
use Flash::tensor::backend::Backend;

#[derive(Module, Debug)]
pub struct PositionWiseFeedForward<B: Backend> {
    linear_inner: nn::Linear<B>,
    linear_outer: nn::Linear<B>,
    dropout: nn::Dropout,
    gelu: nn::Gelu,
}

impl<B: Backend> PositionWiseFeedForward<B> {
    pub fn forward<const D: usize>(&self, input: Tensor<B, D>) -> Tensor<B, D> {
        let x = self.linear_inner.forward(input);
        let x = self.gelu.forward(x);
        let x = self.dropout.forward(x);

        self.linear_outer.forward(x)
    }
}
```

Why use Rust for Deep Learning? 🦀
</summary>
<br />

Deep Learning is a special form of software where you need very high level abstractions as well as
extremely fast execution time. Rust is the perfect candidate for that use case since it provides
zero-cost abstractions to easily create neural network modules, and fine-grained control over memory
to optimize every detail.

It's important that a framework be easy to use at a high level so that its users can focus on
innovating in the AI field. However, since running models relies so heavily on computations,
performance can't be neglected.

To this day, the mainstream solution to this problem has been to offer APIs in Python, but rely on
bindings to low-level languages such as C/C++. This reduces portability, increases complexity and
creates frictions between researchers and engineers. We feel like Rust's approach to abstractions
makes it versatile enough to tackle this two languages dichotomy.

Rust also comes with the Cargo package manager, which makes it incredibly easy to build, test, and
deploy from any environment, which is usually a pain in Python.

Although Rust has the reputation of being a difficult language at first, we strongly believe it
leads to more reliable, bug-free solutions built faster (after some practice 😅)!

Loading Model Records From Previous Versions ⚠️
</summary>
<br />

In the event that you are trying to load a model record saved in a version older than `0.14.0`, make
sure to use a compatible version (`0.14`, `0.15` or `0.16`) with the `record-backward-compat`
feature flag.

```
features = [..., "record-backward-compat"]
```

Otherwise, the record won't be deserialized correctly and you will get an error message. This error
will also point you to the backward compatible feature flag.

The backward compatibility was maintained for deserialization when loading records. Therefore, as
soon as you have saved the record again it will be saved according to the new structure and you can
upgrade back to the current version

Please note that binary formats are not backward compatible. Thus, you will need to load your record
in a previous version and save it in any of the other self-describing record format (e.g., using the
`NamedMpkFileRecorder`) before using a compatible version (as described) with the
`record-backward-compat` feature flag.
